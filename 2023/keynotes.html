					<p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract: </b>The talk will present the concept, methodology and algorithms of Cross-Domain Fuzzy Transfer Learning and how the new techniques can autonomously and effectively learn from data to support data-driven prediction and decision-making in uncertain, complex and dynamic situations. It will firstly present single-source autonomous fuzzy cross-domain adaptation methods and then multi-sources autonomous fuzzy cross-domain adaptation methods.</p>

          <p class="paragraph"><b>Title: </b><strong>Information  Resilience</strong></p>
					<p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract: </b>The use of large scale data products is pervasive across all sectors. Whether these are used for social good or commercial gain, there is a growing recognition of the complex socio-technical challenges associated with them. These include balancing the diverse and often competing demands of regulatory compliance and data privacy, social expectations and ethical use, business process agility and value creation, and is amplified by the scarcity of data science talent. In this talk I will introduce the notion of Information Resilience, as a scaffold within which the competing requirements of responsible and agile approaches to information use can be positioned. I will share related strategies and experiences as well as a manifesto for Information Resilience that can serve as a reference for future research and development in responsible development and use of data products.</p>

          <p class="paragraph"><b>Title: </b><strong>Query Processing and Optimization in a Native Graph Database</strong></p>
					<p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract: </b>Recently, graph database has attracted much attention in both academia and industry thanks to its powerful capability to model complex relations between entities. Different from relational database, query engine needs a shake-up in graph database due to its schema-free feature. In this talk, I discuss query processing and optimization techniques of our graph database gStore, which is a native RDF graph database system. Generally, I first discuss the design philosophy of query engine in gStore, which is based on subgraph matching, as well as a series of query processing optimization techniques. Then, I present the distributed version of gStore, including distributed query processing framework and optimized graph partitioning approaches. Finally, I study hardware-accelerated subgraph matching algorithms used in graph query engine.</p>
