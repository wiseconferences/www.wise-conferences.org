  <h2 style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">Keynote 1: Interaction-Oriented Programming for Decentralized Service Engagements</h2>
  <h3>Munindar P. Singh, North Carolina State University</h3>
  <p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p class="secondparagraph">This talk introduces the conception of Interaction-Oriented Programming (IOP), a way of organizing distributed systems comprising autonomous and heterogeneous components.  Crucially, IOP gives first-class status to interactions as opposed to objects or agents.</p>
  <p class="secondparagraph">IOP begins from a fully declarative approach to interaction protocols an architectural abstractions of service engagements that capture the operational aspects of interactions purely in terms of causality and integrity properties and eliminates hidden control states and dependencies.  The resulting model, first, enables capturing application meaning declaratively in terms of commitments and other abstractions for business contracts.  In this way, it lends itself to flexible service engagements, yet enables formally verification for liveness and safety.  Second, the model is naturally realized in a shared-nothing architecture that decouples service endpoints except as necessary for capturing application meaning.  Third, it enables application-level fault tolerance wherein the endpoints reason about their expectations based on a protocol.  Fourth, IOP is naturally realized in modern data-driven architectures, including serverless computing.</p>

  <h3>Jie Lu, University of Technology Sydney</h3>
  <p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p class="secondparagraph">This talk will describe how fuzzy transfer learning can innovatively and effectively learn from data to support data-driven decision-making in uncertain and dynamic situations. The core idea behind fuzzy transfer learning is to leverage previously acquired knowledge to assist in completing a prediction task in a related domain by integrating fuzzy techniques with the transfer learning process. A set of new fuzzy transfer learning theories, methodologies, and algorithms is introduced, which transfers knowledge learned in one or more source domains to target domains. The fuzzy transfer learning set incorporates (1) a fuzzy refinement domain adaptation algorithm by utilizing the fuzzy system and similarity/dissimilarity concepts to modify the target instances' labels for classification; (2) fuzzy rule-based systems with mapping functions by building latent spaces to facilitate knowledge transfer for regression tasks in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios; (3) unsupervised domain adaptation, to recognize newly emerged patterns in target domains that may be unlabelled. Patterns in target domains are recognized by leveraging knowledge from patterns learned from source domains and solutions to heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation via n-dimensional fuzzy geometry and fuzzy equivalence relations. These new developments can enhance data-driven prediction and decision support systems in complex real-world environments.</p>

  <h3>James B. D. Joshi, University of Pittsburgh</h3>
  <p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p class="secondparagraph">Recent advances in computing and information technologies has enabled a hyper-connected cyberspace that has become an intricate part of our society. Enabled by such connectivity and the growing computational power/infrastructures at our disposal, innovative AI and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are increasingly being deployed in various applications. Such AI-driven world has been further fueled by huge amounts of data that is being continuously collected in myriad of ways, including data that has or can reveal highly privacy-sensitive information about us. While AI/ML technologies and the huge amounts of data available can be used for immense benefits for our society, privacy issues pose as a roadblock. Increasing number of privacy regulations being introduced to protect privacy as a basic right further brings various challenges in terms of use of data by AI/ML-enabled applications. In this talk, I will discuss current state of privacy mainly within the context of AI/ML, including current state of privacy-preserving technologies, and discuss various challenges and potential research directions.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">Keynote 4: Efficient Network Embeddings for Large Graphs</h2>
  <h3>Xiaokui Xiao, National University of Singapore</h3>
  <p class="paragraph"><b>Abstract</b></p>
  <p class="secondparagraph">Given a graph G, network embedding maps each node in G into a compact, fixed-dimensional feature vector, which can be used in downstream machine learning tasks. Most of the existing methods for network embedding fail to scale to large graphs with millions of nodes, as they either incur significant computation cost or generate low-quality embeddings on such graphs. In this talk, we will present two efficient network embedding algorithms for large graphs with and without node attributes, respectively. The basic idea is to first model the affinity between nodes (or between nodes and attributes) based on random walks, and then factorize the affinity matrix to derive the embeddings. The main challenges that we address include (i) the choice of the affinity measure and (ii) the reduction of space and time overheads entailed by the construction and factorization of the affinity matrix. Extensive experiments on large graphs demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the existing methods in terms of both embedding quality and efficiency.</p>
