  <h2>Policies</h2>
  <h3>Dual Submission</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">It is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the proceedings.</p>

  <h3>Changes of Title/Abstract/Authorship</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">Authors should include a full title for their paper, as well as a complete abstract by the abstract submission deadline. Submission titles should not be modified after the abstract submission deadline, and abstracts should not be modified by more than 50% after the abstract submission deadline. Submissions violating these rules may be deleted after the paper submission deadline without reviewing. The author list at the submission deadline will be considered final, and no changes in authorship will be permitted for accepted papers.</p>

  <h3>Double-Blind Review</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">All submitted papers MUST be anonymous. WISE 2021 is following the double-blind peer review principle. That is, the authors do not know who reviews their paper and the PC members do not know who the authors of a given paper. Thus, the submitted document should not include the author information and should not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.</p>

  <h3>Reviewing Criteria</h3>
  <p class="paragraph">Accepted papers must contain significant novel results. Results can be either theoretical or empirical. Results will be judged on the degree to which they have been objectively established and/or their potential for scientific and technological impact. Reproducibility of results and easy availability of code will be taken into account in the decision-making process.</p>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Publication</h2>
  <p class="paragraph">Accepted papers will be presented at WISE 2021 and published in the conference proceedings, which is published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Authors elected best papers from the conference will be invited to submit an expanded version for publication in <a style="color:#0082c8" href="https://www.springer.com/journal/11280" target="_blank">World Wide Web Journal</a>, Springer, or <a style="color:#0082c8" href="https://www.springer.com/journal/41019" target="_blank">Data Science and Engineering</a>, Springer.</p>
