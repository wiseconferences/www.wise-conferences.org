					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

					The Network has been developed from Internet, Internet of Things and mobile Internet to ubiquitous network. The network application has been developed from Web1.0, Web2.0 to Web 3.0 as well. Big data mining on network is becoming an emerging hotspot especially in the era of big data. These new technologies, new applications and new demands bring great challenges to the traditional search technology on network. In this lecture, I will comprehensively introduce the big search technology from the aspect of origin, characteristics, main research contents and typical applications.

					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

					Deep neural networks are currently the state-of-the-art in many challenging pattern recognition tasks. They are, however, sensitive to adversarial noise and fooling samples, i.e., samples that are designed to cause the systems to behave in an unexpected manner. In this talk, I will present a novel technique for training robust neural networks and other machine learning models, using our proposed random projection regularizer. I will then present some recent theoretical results connecting adversarial robustness of classifiers with the intrinsic dimensionality of the data representation.

					<b>Title:</b> Mining Log Data for System Management <br/>

	

          				<b>Speaker:</b> Prof. Tao Li, School of Computer Science at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications & School of 
Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University<br/>



					<b>Abstract: </b><br/>

					Over the years, the advancements in science and technology have led to the increased complexity in computing systems. The systems are thus becoming increasingly more complex with growing number of heterogeneous software and hardware components, increasingly more difficult to monitor, manage and maintain. Traditional approaches for system management have been largely based on domain experts through a knowledge acquisition process that translates domain knowledge into operational rules, policies, and dependency models. This has been well known and experienced as a cumbersome, labor intensive, and error prone process. The process is extremely expensive, if not impossible, to keep up with the rapidly changing environment, especially for such complex systems. There is thus a pressing need for automatic and efficient approaches to monitor and manage complex systems. In this talk, I will present the techniques that my group has developed on mining log data for automatic system management.   In particular, these techniques include methods that can transform system log data in disparate formats and contents into a canonical form, which creates consistency across similar fields and improves the ability to correlate across multiple logs; methods for data-driven pattern discovery and problem determination; and methods for bridging the gap between the applications and intelligent algorithms.  These techniques constitute a holistic effort for automatic system management.<br/>
