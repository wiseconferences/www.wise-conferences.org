Famous writer
Konstantin Paustovskiy wrote: «I suppose, nowhere near Moscow such typically and pathetically Russian places
as regards landscape are available». Such commonly Russia-personified land of the Oka River midstream gives the
key to awareness about the Russian people being farmers, warriors, constructors, philosophers and explorers.
Vehemence goes along with a mystery, and together they penetrate the Russian tales and country songs reflecting the
soul of the nation, in which «the flows of tenderness are replaced by the rapids of ferocious melancholy» as was
remarked by geographer and poet Vladimir Solntsev. The Oka River lands are totally preoccupied and filled with
the Russian history.<br/><b><a href="http://www.russianmuseums.info/M531" target="_blank">Yasnaya Polyana village.&nbsp;</a></b>This corner of the Russian land hosts the estate of Leo Tolstoy. This is where the world-known writer was born,
lived for half a century and was buried. There Tolstoy created the masterpieces, which made his literary career
so bright. Yasnaya Polyana itself organically intervened his writing. while reading his book «War and Peace» it
can be easily recognized in the Lysye Gory estate of Duke Bolkonskiy, who himself was described as the writer’s
grandfather Nikolay Volkonskiy. He retired as General in 1790s and stayed at the estate, found himself busy with
constructing new premises surrounded by a grand park. At present, the former estate is a large literary
museum-reserve famed worldwide.<br/><b><a href="http://imesta.ru/places/show/243/" target="_blank">Serpukhov town&nbsp;</a></b>has been known since 1336 as the strategic point to defend the place from battles with Mongol-tartars and Polish
invaders. The town still preserves the remains of white-stone Kremlin walls surrounding the Soborny  (Cathedral)
Mount, Troitsky (Trinity) cathedral in the kremlin, Troitsky and Iliinsky churches «on the trading place»,
Sretensky (Purification) church and Pokrovsky (Intercession) or (Old Believers') church. On the right bank of
the Nara River, at the confluence with the Oka River there is Vladychny (Hierarchal) nunnery dated back to 1360.
In time of frequent tartars’ raids in the XV to XVII century the nunnery was fenced off by the walls and looked
as a fortress. In 1806, it was converted to a nunnery. On the opposite bank there is Vysotsky (High) monastery
erected in 1374 by Vladimir Donskoy, the brother of Dmitriy Donskoy, on a high hill (so the name is derived from
the height), taken out by request of Sergey Radonezhskiy. His follower Afanasiy was appointed as the head of a
monastery, and after he had moved to the TsarGrad, Afanasiy II was elected to serve as a superior. Amongst the
church sanctuaries there are relics of about 200 God’s saints including those of Sergey Radonezhskiy. In 1571 the
monastery was  devastated by the Crimean-Tatar forces led by Khan Devlet-Girey. The fence and 4 towers were built
in 1647. In clear weather, when looking from the monastery walls you are impressed by the vastness of the
Oka River valley. On the opposite side the Serpukhov town also unfolds majestic panorama reaching the Oka River.
